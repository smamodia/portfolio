        Welcome to my portfolio website! I am Sarakshi Mamodia, an 18-year-old girl currently<br> 
        pursuing Computer Science Engineering at VJTI, Matunga. Coding is not just a skill for me;<br>
        it's a passion that drives me to explore new technologies and create innovative solutions. <br>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and<br>
        flavors, or curled up with a good book, exploring different worlds through literature.<br> 
        Dance is another passion of mine, as it allows me to express myself creatively and stay active.<br>
        I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you through this platform.<br>

            <h3>St. Thomas School</h3>
            <p>
                St. Thomas School holds a special place in my heart, as it was where I spent my formative years<br>
                from 1st to 5th class. The school's sprawling campus and expansive grounds provided the perfect <br>
                environment for learning and play. The campus was so vast that it felt like a mini-town, with <br>
                separate buildings for classrooms, a library, and a playground that seemed to stretch on forever.<br>
                I have fond memories of running around the playground with my friends, playing games and enjoying <br>
                the fresh air. Even though I have moved on to new chapters in my life, I often find myself reminiscing <br> 
                about my time at St. Thomas School and missing the sense of community and belonging that it provided. <br>

            <h3>Podar International School</h3>
            <p>
            My high school years at Podar International School were nothing short of memorable. It was a time filled <br>
            with learning, growth, and the formation of lifelong friendships. The school provided a nurturing <br>
            environment that allowed me to flourish academically and socially. I am proud to have scored 95% in my 12th<br>
            board exams, a testament to the hard work and dedication I put into my studies. Additionally, achieving a<br>
            99.05 percentile in the MHT CET exam was a moment of great pride for me, reflecting my passion for academics <br>
            nd commitment to excellence. Podar International School will always hold a special place in my heart, as it <br>
            not only prepared me for the future but also gave me cherished memories and lasting friendships.<br>

         <h3>Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute</h3>
         <p>
          I am currently studying Computer Science Engineering at VJTI has been an enriching experience filled with opportunities for <br>
          growth and learning. The college's vibrant atmosphere, coupled with its strong academic curriculum, has helped me develop both  <br>
          personally and professionally. Participating in fests, carnivals, and events like Traditional Day has been a highlight, allowing <br>
        me to showcase my talents, interact with peers, and immerse myself in the diverse culture of VJTI. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time <br>
            here, and it has only strengthened my resolve to pursue a career as a front-end developer. The support from faculty and the  <br>
            exposure to practical knowledge have been instrumental in shaping my aspirations and fueling my passion for technology.  <br>
